   As of the 2012.07.15 installation media release, AIF (the Arch
   Installation Framework) is no longer included but instead Arch Install
   Scripts are provided to aid in the installation process. This article
   summarizes the install process using these scripts. See the Beginners'
   Guide instead for a walkthrough aimed at new users.

Download

   Download the new Arch Linux ISO from the Arch Linux download page.
     * Instead of six different images we only provide a single one which
       can be booted into an i686 and x86_64 live system to install Arch
       Linux over the network. Media containing the [core] repository are
       no longer provided.
     * Install images are signed and it is highly recommend to verify
       their signature before use. On Arch Linux, this can be done by
       using
pacman-key -v <iso-file>.sig
     * The image can be burned to a CD, mounted as an ISO file, or
       directly written to a USB stick using a utility like dd. It is
       intended for new installations only; an existing Arch Linux system
       can always be updated with pacman -Syu.

Keyboard layout

   For many countries and keyboard types appropriate keymaps are available
   already, and a command like loadkeys uk might do what you want. More
   available keymap files can be found in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ (you can
   omit the keymap path and file extension when using loadkeys).

Partition disks

   See partitioning for details.

   Remember to create any stacked block devices like LVM, LUKS, or RAID.

Format partitions

   See here for details.

   If you are using (U)EFI you will most probably need another partition
   to host the UEFI System partition. Read this article.

Mount the partitions

   We now must mount the root partition on /mnt. You should also create
   directories for and mount any other partitions (/mnt/boot, /mnt/home,
   ...) if you want them to be detected by genfstab.

Connect to the internet

   Assuming a wired connection, running dhclient or dhcpcd is sufficient
   to get a lease. For more info visit configuring network.

  Wireless

   Run wifi-menu to set up your wireless network. For details, see
   Wireless Setup and Netcfg.

Install the base system

   Before installing, you may want to edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist such
   that your preferred mirror is first. This copy of the mirrorlist will
   be installed on your new system by pacstrap as well, so it's worth
   getting it right.

   Using the pacstrap script we install the base system. The base-devel
   package group should also be installed if you plan on compiling
   software from the AUR or using ABS.
# pacstrap /mnt base base-devel

   Other packages can be installed by appending their names to the above
   command (space seperated), including the bootloader if you want.

Install a bootloader

  GRUB

     * For BIOS:

# pacstrap /mnt grub-bios

     * For EFI (in rare cases you will need grub-efi-i386 instead):

# pacstrap /mnt grub-efi-x86_64

     * Install GRUB after chrooting (refer to Configure system section).

  Syslinux

# pacstrap /mnt syslinux

Configure system

   Generate an fstab with the following command (if you prefer to use
   UUIDs or labels, add the -U or -L option, respectively):
# genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

   Next we chroot into our newly installed system:
# arch-chroot /mnt

     * Write your hostname to /etc/hostname.
     * Symlink /etc/localtime to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone. Replace
       Zone and Subzone to your liking. For example:

# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Athens /etc/localtime

     * Set locale preferences in /etc/locale.conf.
     * Add console keymap and font preferences in /etc/vconsole.conf
     * Uncomment the selected locale in /etc/locale.gen and generate it
       with locale-gen.
     * Configure /etc/mkinitcpio.conf as needed (see mkinitcpio) and
       create an initial RAM disk with:

# mkinitcpio -p linux

     * Configure the bootloader: refer back to the appropriate article
       from the bootloader installation section.

     * Set a root password with passwd.

Unmount leftovers

   If you are still in the chroot environment type exit or press Ctrl+D in
   order to exit. Earlier we mounted the partitions under /mnt. In this
   step we will unmount them:
# umount /mnt/{boot,home,}

   Finally reboot and configure your system as explained in Beginners'
   Guide/Post-Installation.
