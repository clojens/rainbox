A lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course,
but as far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application. It seemed
such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our
software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.

This is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive
business, prone to natural monopolies. A company that gets software written
faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out
of business.

The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you're running
a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it,
you can expect to do as well as the average big company-- that is, to grow
about ten percent a year.

The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course. If you do
everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average
performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you'll go out
of business. The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. So
if you're running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not,
you're in trouble.

It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon--
that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a
secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized. No one was leaking news
of their features to us. We were just able to develop software faster than
anyone thought possible.
