Arch Linux is a rolling release, and new library versions will be pushed to the
repositories. The developers and Trusted Users will rebuild all the packages in
the repositories that need to be rebuilt against the libraries. If the system
has locally installed packages (such as AUR packages), users will need to
rebuild them when their dependencies receive a soname bump.

This means that partial upgrades are not supported.

Do not use `pacman -Sy <package>` or any equivalent such as `pacman -Sy` and then
`pacman -S <package>`.  Always upgrade before installing a package --
particularly if pacman has refreshed the sync repositories. Be very careful
when using IgnorePkg and IgnoreGroup for the same reason.

If a partial upgrade scenario has been created, and binaries are broken because
they cannot find the libraries they are linked against, do not "fix" the
problem simply by symlinking. Libraries receive soname bumps when they are not
backwards compatible. A simple pacman -Syu to a properly synced mirror will fix
the issue as long as pacman is not broken.
