=======

This repository contains my collection of configuration scripts and other code,
packages, bash/zsh and what not - aimed more or less in the direction of a
custom arch (isolinux). A more elaborate version of dotfiles in early stages as
I dig through many unorganized snippets and upload this in the course of years.
